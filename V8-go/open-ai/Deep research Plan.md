Awesome. I will now create a detailed multi-iteration plan to explore, understand, and port the latest V8 engine from C++ to pure Go, ensuring full feature parity, best-possible performance, and automated tests at each stage. I'll also design a context management strategy to mirror how a human would handle complex codebases without overwhelming memory.

I'll get back to you shortly with a structured workflow!

# Multi-Iteration Plan to Port V8 Engine from C++ to Go

## Iteration 1: Codebase Setup and Survey  
Begin with a high-level survey of V8’s architecture and codebase.  The V8 engine includes a JavaScript parser (producing an AST), a bytecode interpreter (Ignition), and an optimizing JIT compiler (TurboFan) ([The V8 Engine Series I: Architecture | by Mahmoud Yasser | Medium](https://braineanear.medium.com/the-v8-engine-series-i-architecture-ba08a38c54fa#:~:text=2)) ([The V8 Engine Series I: Architecture | by Mahmoud Yasser | Medium](https://braineanear.medium.com/the-v8-engine-series-i-architecture-ba08a38c54fa#:~:text=TurboFan%20is%20an%20optimizing%20compiler,level%20to%20provide%20higher%20performance)).  It also uses a modern generational GC (Orinoco) that runs mostly concurrently ([Trash talk: the Orinoco garbage collector · V8](https://v8.dev/blog/trash-talk#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%20years%20the,concurrent%20collector%20with%20incremental%20fallback)) ([Trash talk: the Orinoco garbage collector · V8](https://v8.dev/blog/trash-talk#:~:text=Minor%20GC%20%28Scavenger%29%20)).  As context, review official overviews or recent blog summaries of V8’s layers ([The V8 Engine Series I: Architecture | by Mahmoud Yasser | Medium](https://braineanear.medium.com/the-v8-engine-series-i-architecture-ba08a38c54fa#:~:text=2)) ([The V8 Engine Series I: Architecture | by Mahmoud Yasser | Medium](https://braineanear.medium.com/the-v8-engine-series-i-architecture-ba08a38c54fa#:~:text=TurboFan%20is%20an%20optimizing%20compiler,level%20to%20provide%20higher%20performance)).  Map these components onto the code repository structure to form a mental map.  

- **Set up development environment:**  Clone the latest V8 source code (e.g. via Depot Tools), and build it on a supported platform.  Ensure you can compile and run the existing V8 tests and sample applications.  
- **Explore repository layout:**  Identify top-level folders (e.g. `src`, `include`, `tools`, `third_party`) and note where key subsystems live (parser, compiler, runtime, GC).  Look for code organization clues (e.g. directories like `src/parsing`, `src/interpreter`, `src/compiler`, `src/heap`).  
- **Run a simple example:**  Use the V8 shell (`d8`) to execute a “Hello world” script or basic JavaScript.  This helps confirm your build and gives initial insight into how code and command-line tools interact.  
- **Gather documentation:**  Collect V8’s official design docs or relevant blog posts (e.g. the V8 engine series) ([The V8 Engine Series I: Architecture | by Mahmoud Yasser | Medium](https://braineanear.medium.com/the-v8-engine-series-i-architecture-ba08a38c54fa#:~:text=2)) ([The V8 Engine Series I: Architecture | by Mahmoud Yasser | Medium](https://braineanear.medium.com/the-v8-engine-series-i-architecture-ba08a38c54fa#:~:text=TurboFan%20is%20an%20optimizing%20compiler,level%20to%20provide%20higher%20performance)).  Start a shared design document file (Markdown or similar) and outline the high-level architecture – parser → AST → Ignition → TurboFan – as described in those references.  
- **Context strategy:**  At this stage, keep a broad focus.  Avoid getting lost in code details; instead, form a top-level mental model of components and data flow.  Use diagrams or notes to capture the big picture, reserving code deep-dives for later.  

## Iteration 2: High-Level Architecture Mapping  
Deepen understanding by linking documented layers to actual code.  For example, V8’s TurboFan uses a graph-based “Sea of Nodes” intermediate representation ([TurboFan · V8](https://v8.dev/docs/turbofan#:~:text=TurboFan%20is%20one%20of%20V8%E2%80%99s,found%20in%20the%20following%20resources)).  In this iteration, identify where each major component resides in the code and how they interact.  

- **Trace the execution flow:**  Follow a simple JavaScript execution through V8’s layers: source code → parser → AST → Ignition bytecode → (TurboFan) machine code.  Annotate your design doc with key functions or classes for each step (e.g. parser entry points, interpreter loop, JIT driver).  
- **Locate code modules:**  Find V8 source directories/files corresponding to each layer (e.g. parser code in `src/parsing`, Ignition in `src/interpreter`, TurboFan in `src/compiler`).  Note any initializers (e.g. V8 `Shell` or `Isolate` creation) and the embedding APIs that drive startup.  
- **Inspect build scripts:**  Examine how V8’s build system (GN, GYP) sets up components.  Understanding dependencies and compile flags will help plan how to reimplement features in Go.  
- **Update design doc:**  Add sections describing each module and its high-level behavior.  Draw simple architecture diagrams (boxes for Parser, Ignition, TurboFan, GC, etc.) with arrows indicating data flow.  This living design document will guide later implementation.  
- **Context strategy:**  Continue to chunk information: treat each component separately (parser vs JIT vs GC).  Don’t try to memorize everything; keep referring to your evolving architectural diagram to recall how parts fit together.

## Iteration 3: Deep Dive – Parser and AST  
Focus on V8’s JavaScript parser.  The V8 parser converts JS source into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for further processing ([The V8 Engine Series I: Architecture | by Mahmoud Yasser | Medium](https://braineanear.medium.com/the-v8-engine-series-i-architecture-ba08a38c54fa#:~:text=Before%20executing%20the%20JavaScript%20code%2C,syntax%20of%20the%20source%20code)).  Understanding this layer is crucial because it defines how JS code is represented internally.  

- **Examine parser implementation:**  Read V8’s parser code (look under `src/parsing` and related files).  Identify key classes (e.g. `Parser`, `Scanner`, `AstNode`, etc.) and how they work together.  Note any parsing strategies (recursive descent, etc.) and how the AST is structured.  
- **Study AST structure:**  Find definitions of AST node classes or structs.  Document how different JS constructs (literals, expressions, statements) map to AST node types.  Note how scope and environments are represented (likely via scope info objects).  
- **Compare to ECMAScript spec:**  (If necessary) cross-reference the ES grammar to understand parser design decisions (e.g. how modules, classes, functions are parsed).  V8 may have spec-driven tests.  
- **Document parser design:**  Update the design doc with how the parser works and how a Go implementation might look.  For example, will you reuse Go’s existing parser libraries or write a custom JS parser in Go?  Sketch any needed data structures in Go (structs for AST nodes).  
- **Task examples:** Try adding simple debug prints or using a debugger to step through a parse of a small JS file.  Observe how tokens are consumed and nodes are created.  
- **Iteration goal:** After this, you should be able to explain how V8 takes JS code and produces an in-memory AST.  Record this understanding in the design doc.

## Iteration 4: Deep Dive – Ignition Interpreter and Bytecode  
Investigate V8’s Ignition component.  Ignition compiles the AST into bytecode, then interprets it to execute JS code and collect runtime feedback ([The V8 Engine Series I: Architecture | by Mahmoud Yasser | Medium](https://braineanear.medium.com/the-v8-engine-series-i-architecture-ba08a38c54fa#:~:text=Once%20the%20AST%20is%20formed%2C,within%20V8%E2%80%99s%20optimizing%20compiler%2C%20TurboFan)) ([The V8 Engine Series I: Architecture | by Mahmoud Yasser | Medium](https://braineanear.medium.com/the-v8-engine-series-i-architecture-ba08a38c54fa#:~:text=After%20the%20generation%20of%20the,for%20a%20couple%20of%20reasons)).  This is V8’s baseline execution engine.  

- **Review bytecode generation:**  Locate the code where the AST is traversed to emit bytecode instructions (likely in `src/interpreter`).  Identify the bytecode instruction set (file listing opcodes) and understand common instructions (Load, Store, Arithmetic, etc.).  
- **Interpreter loop:**  Find how Ignition executes bytecode (an interpreter loop).  Note how it handles the accumulator register, stack frames, and feedback collection.  Document how type and call frequency feedback is gathered for TurboFan later.  
- **Performance considerations:**  Note comments about bytecode size and efficiency.  (V8 documentation says bytecode is compact, e.g. “between 50 and 25 percent the size of an equivalent baseline machine code” ([The V8 Engine Series I: Architecture | by Mahmoud Yasser | Medium](https://braineanear.medium.com/the-v8-engine-series-i-architecture-ba08a38c54fa#:~:text=Ignition%20compiles%20JavaScript%20functions%20with,generated%20by%20V8%E2%80%99s%20baseline%20compiler)).)  
- **Plan Go equivalent:**  Outline how to represent bytecode and the interpreter in Go.  For example, define a Go enum or iota constants for opcodes, and write an interpreter loop in Go.  Consider how to integrate this with Go’s runtime (e.g. using switch-case or function tables).  
- **Design doc additions:**  Describe the bytecode format, interpreter algorithm, and how runtime feedback will be stored.  Note any dependencies (e.g. how objects and functions are represented) needed by Ignition.  
- **Testing:**  Write or adapt simple JS snippets to test the parsed AST and interpreter execution (output values, side-effects).  Automate running these through the existing V8 to compare results, if practical.  
- **Iteration goal:** You should be familiar with V8’s interpreter: it runs bytecode produced from the AST and sets the stage for optimization.

## Iteration 5: Deep Dive – TurboFan JIT Compiler  
Turn to V8’s optimizing compiler.  TurboFan takes the profile-guided data and bytecode from Ignition and generates optimized machine code ([The V8 Engine Series I: Architecture | by Mahmoud Yasser | Medium](https://braineanear.medium.com/the-v8-engine-series-i-architecture-ba08a38c54fa#:~:text=TurboFan%20is%20an%20optimizing%20compiler,level%20to%20provide%20higher%20performance)).  It uses a sophisticated intermediate representation (“Sea of Nodes”) ([TurboFan · V8](https://v8.dev/docs/turbofan#:~:text=TurboFan%20is%20one%20of%20V8%E2%80%99s,found%20in%20the%20following%20resources)) to perform optimizations.  

- **Study IR and pipeline:**  Read about TurboFan’s design.  The V8 documentation notes “Sea of Nodes” and a multi-layered optimization pipeline ([TurboFan · V8](https://v8.dev/docs/turbofan#:~:text=TurboFan%20is%20one%20of%20V8%E2%80%99s,found%20in%20the%20following%20resources)).  Identify where TurboFan’s IR (graph nodes) are constructed in code (`src/compiler` or `src/codegen`).  
- **Optimization techniques:**  Note key optimizations (inlining, constant propagation, dead code elimination, etc.) by reading design docs or comments.  Document any special V8 idioms (e.g. how type feedback triggers certain optimizations).  
- **Mapping to Go:**  Decide how to handle JIT in Go.  Options include: generate Go assembly (using `asm` packages or `go:asm` directives), emit native code via a codegen library, or even compile to WebAssembly (if stepping outside “pure Go” is allowed).  Note challenges: Go’s toolchain isn’t designed for runtime code emission.  
- **Design doc:**  Outline a strategy for JIT.  For example, you might first implement a simple baseline compiler (converting bytecode to Go functions) and later add optimizations.  Describe how you would represent the IR in Go (structs for nodes) and how a code generator might work.  
- **Dependencies:**  Identify any V8 builtins (runtime library routines) that JIT might rely on and plan their Go equivalents.  
- **Iteration goal:** Gain enough understanding to describe TurboFan’s role and to sketch how an optimizing compiler could be built in Go.  The design doc should include this JIT plan.

## Iteration 6: Deep Dive – Memory Management and Garbage Collection  
Examine V8’s heap and garbage collector.  V8 uses a generational, mostly concurrent GC (Orinoco) with a minor (Scavenger) and major (Mark-Compact) collector ([Trash talk: the Orinoco garbage collector · V8](https://v8.dev/blog/trash-talk#:~:text=Minor%20GC%20%28Scavenger%29%20)) ([Trash talk: the Orinoco garbage collector · V8](https://v8.dev/blog/trash-talk#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%20years%20the,concurrent%20collector%20with%20incremental%20fallback)).  Understand these to plan Go adaptations.  

- **Learn V8 GC design:**  Read the Orinoco GC blog post ([Trash talk: the Orinoco garbage collector · V8](https://v8.dev/blog/trash-talk#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%20years%20the,concurrent%20collector%20with%20incremental%20fallback)) ([Trash talk: the Orinoco garbage collector · V8](https://v8.dev/blog/trash-talk#:~:text=Minor%20GC%20%28Scavenger%29%20)) and V8 source (`src/heap`).  Note heap layout: how objects are allocated (new space, old space, code space), and how the two collectors work.  For example, young-gen uses semi-space copying (scavenge), and old-gen uses mark-sweep-compact.  
- **Investigate memory allocation:**  Find how V8 allocates memory for JS objects (the “HeapObject” class) and maintains free lists or bump pointers.  Note any write barriers or tracking of inter-generational pointers (e.g. remembered sets) ([Trash talk: the Orinoco garbage collector · V8](https://v8.dev/blog/trash-talk#:~:text=For%20scavenging%2C%20we%20have%20an,through%20the%20entire%20old%20generation)).  
- **Plan Go memory strategy:**  Go provides its own garbage collector, so you may not need to implement full GC.  One approach is to let Go allocate all objects on its heap (using Go structs) and rely on Go’s GC for liveness.  Alternatively, implement a custom allocator in Go if needed for performance or to mimic V8 semantics.  Decide which V8 GC invariants must be preserved (e.g. weak references, finalization) and how Go’s runtime can handle them.  
- **Design doc:**  Document the V8 GC strategy and your Go approach.  For instance, note that Go’s garbage collector is not generational, so short-lived objects might survive longer.  Outline how to handle large objects, code space, and how to trigger GC in Go (using `runtime.GC()` as needed).  
- **Supporting code:**  Plan to write memory utility packages in Go (e.g. allocation pools, arena allocators if needed, or helpers wrapping Go’s `make` and `new`).  Consider using `sync.Pool` for temporary objects to reduce pressure.  
- **Iteration goal:** Understand the trade-offs of using Go’s GC versus reimplementing V8’s.  By now, your design doc should compare V8’s and Go’s memory models and state the chosen approach.

## Iteration 7: Deep Dive – Runtime Objects and Built-ins  
Focus on V8’s runtime object model.  V8 defines internal representations for JS values: e.g. `HeapObject`, `JSObject`, `JSArray`, `String`, etc.  It also includes all built-in functions and classes.  

- **Inspect object hierarchy:**  Explore `src/objects` and `src/runtime` in V8.  Identify core classes like `HeapObject`, `FixedArray`, `Map`, and JS-builtins (`JSObject`, `JSFunction`, `JSArray`, `JSString`, etc.).  Document how inheritance/polymorphism is implemented (often via C++ classes and maps of types).  
- **Detail built-ins implementation:**  Look at key built-in methods (e.g. `Array.prototype.push`, `String.prototype.split`) in `src/builtins` or generated code stubs.  Understand how V8 implements them in C++ (many built-ins are actually bytecode or CSA-generated code).  
- **Go struct designs:**  Plan Go structs to represent JS values (perhaps with a common interface or union type).  For example, a Go `Value` type could be an interface or struct with a tag for type and embedded value.  Sketch representations for objects (maps or struct fields) and arrays (slices).  
- **Design doc:**  Add a section enumerating essential JS types and their Go counterparts.  Note where V8’s optimizations (e.g. tagged pointers, Smi (small integer) optimization) might be simplified or replaced in Go.  Describe how to handle property maps, hidden classes, and prototype chains conceptually.  
- **Tasks:**  As a practical step, implement a small Go prototype of a JS object with a map for properties.  Write unit tests to confirm correct lookup/inheritance behavior.  
- **Iteration goal:** Achieve clarity on how JS semantics (objects, functions, scope) are realized in V8, and have concrete ideas for representing them in Go.  The design document should include a sketch of the object model conversion.

## Iteration 8: Deep Dive – Embedding API, Isolates, and Contexts  
Study how V8 is embedded in host applications.  V8 uses `Isolate` (an independent VM instance) and `Context` (execution environment within an isolate).  Note thread-safety rules: each `Isolate` is tied to one thread, and contexts are not thread-safe ([Explanation of architecture · Issue #129 · rogchap/v8go · GitHub](https://github.com/rogchap/v8go/issues/129#:~:text=Isolates%20and%20Context%20are%20NOT,thread%20or%20not%2C%20to%20run)).  

- **Explore embedding API:**  Review V8’s C++ API for creating isolates and contexts (`v8::Isolate`, `v8::Context`, etc.).  Identify how execution is started (e.g. `isolate->Run()` or equivalent).  Note how external code passes arguments, retrieves values, and controls execution (e.g. handling promises or traps).  
- **Concurrency model:**  V8 is essentially single-threaded per isolate.  As one comment notes, an `Isolate` cannot be used concurrently on multiple threads without explicit locking ([Explanation of architecture · Issue #129 · rogchap/v8go · GitHub](https://github.com/rogchap/v8go/issues/129#:~:text=Isolates%20and%20Context%20are%20NOT,thread%20or%20not%2C%20to%20run)).  In Go, plan to model this by having one goroutine or OS thread per isolate (using `runtime.LockOSThread()` if necessary) and avoiding data races.  Parallelism can be achieved by multiple isolates.  
- **API mapping:**  Determine which parts of V8’s embedding API need Go equivalents.  For example, how to create and switch contexts, how to interact with JS values from Go code, etc.  Sketch an API surface in Go (perhaps with methods like `NewIsolate()`, `CompileScript()`, `CallFunction()`).  
- **Design doc:**  Document the isolate-context model and concurrency constraints.  Explain how Go’s goroutines and channels might be used for isolate management (e.g. a pool of worker goroutines each with its own isolate).  Note any Go runtime flags needed (like thread locking) to match V8’s behavior.  
- **Iteration goal:** You should fully understand how V8 expects to be embedded and how multiple execution threads are handled.  The plan for Go should enforce the same constraints (one JS thread per isolate) to avoid subtle bugs.

## Iteration 9: Final Review and Design Document Completion  
By this point, you should have a thorough understanding of all V8 components and have begun sketching the Go design.  Use this iteration to consolidate that knowledge and produce a detailed design document.  

- **Review dependencies:**  List all external dependencies V8 uses (e.g. platform-specific code, assembly stubs, V8’s internal libraries).  Note which ones have Go equivalents or need to be reimplemented.  
- **Finalize design document:**  Write out the full architecture in the design doc: system overview, module breakdown, data structures, algorithms, and Go translation strategy.  Include diagrams or tables comparing V8 classes to proposed Go types.  Ensure the document covers memory, concurrency, performance, and testing considerations.  
- **Peer review:**  If possible, have the design doc reviewed by other engineers or experts.  Incorporate feedback.  Clarify any sections that are still vague.  
- **Plan next steps:**  Define how you will transition from research to implementation.  For example, decide on milestones for writing code.  This plan will inform the upcoming porting iterations.  
- **Iteration goal:** Achieve “complete mastery” of V8’s architecture and have a published design blueprint for the Go port.  At the end of this step, you should feel confident that you know how every major V8 module will be handled.

## Iteration 10: Implementation Phase – Scaffolding Core Types and Utilities  
Begin the actual porting by creating the basic Go framework.  Set up the Go project structure, modules, and foundational code.  

- **Project setup:**  Initialize a Go module (e.g. `go mod init`).  Organize directories to mirror V8’s structure (e.g. `parser/`, `interpreter/`, `compiler/`, `runtime/`, etc.).  Ensure your build works (`go build`) and dependencies (if any) are managed.  
- **Core types:**  Implement the fundamental Go types for JavaScript values (e.g. a `Value` interface or struct, and concrete types for `Number`, `String`, `Object`, etc.).  Include basic operations (type checks, conversions).  This will be the foundation for all modules.  
- **Utility packages:**  Write common utilities, such as error handling, logging, and a simple object (`JSObject`) implementation with property storage (a `map[string]Value`).  Develop memory helpers (wrapper over Go’s allocators) for later use.  
- **Go-specific memory alternatives:**  Since Go is garbage-collected, you may start by allocating all objects on Go’s heap.  Create an abstraction (e.g. a factory or helper function) for allocating JS objects, so that you can later replace it with a custom allocator if needed.  
- **Tooling:**  Set up automated linting (`golangci-lint`) and formatting.  Establish a CI pipeline that runs `go test` to ensure scaffolding remains buildable.  
- **Testing:**  Write unit tests for the core types and utilities (e.g. verify that your `Value` type correctly represents different JS values).  This ensures a stable base for later work.  
- **Iteration goal:** Have a minimal Go codebase with no compile errors, defining the skeleton of the engine’s data model.  You should be able to compile and run an empty “engine” that builds without logic.

## Iteration 11: Implementation Phase – Parser and AST Module  
Port or implement the parser in Go according to the design.  

- **Parser implementation:**  Either write a JS parser in Go or integrate an existing one.  Ensure it can parse JS source into an AST matching your design.  If writing one, translate the logic discovered in Iteration 3 into Go (tokenizer, recursive descent functions).  If using a library, adapt its output to your AST type.  
- **AST structures:**  Create Go structs for AST nodes (from iteration 3).  Ensure they capture all necessary information (node type, child pointers, source ranges if needed).  Example:  
  ```go
  type ASTNode struct {
      Type    NodeType
      Value   interface{}
      Children []ASTNode
      // ... other fields ...
  }
  ```  
- **AST builder:**  Write functions that build AST nodes from parsed tokens/grammar.  Include error handling for syntax errors.  Support features up to the target ECMAScript version (e.g. ES6 classes if planning full V8 support).  
- **Testing:**  Create test cases with small JS snippets and compare the generated AST structure to expectations.  (You can write manual checks or use a golden file of serialized ASTs.)  Also run the V8 shell on those snippets to verify no parse errors.  
- **Design doc update:**  Record any changes needed based on implementation (e.g. if a Go parser lacks a feature).  Note how error reporting and debugging will work (e.g. include source locations).  
- **Iteration goal:** You should have a working Go parser that can convert basic JS code into your AST format.  This is critical for driving the rest of the engine.

## Iteration 12: Implementation Phase – Interpreter (Ignition)  
Implement the bytecode generation and interpreter in Go.  

- **Bytecode compiler:**  Traverse your AST and emit bytecode instructions.  Create a bytecode representation (e.g. a slice of structs or ints).  Ensure it matches the scheme you studied (like a custom `Instruction` struct with opcode and operands).  
- **Interpreter loop:**  Write the Go code that interprets the bytecode.  Use a switch-case or jump table on opcodes to execute behavior (e.g. pushing/popping values, arithmetic).  Maintain an accumulator/register and stack as needed.  Perform runtime operations on the `Value` types (from Iteration 10).  
- **Feedback collection:**  Implement a basic mechanism for collecting runtime feedback (e.g. counters for function calls, observed types).  This can be simple (just increment counters) but should mirror Ignition’s role in driving optimization.  
- **Testing:**  Run JavaScript programs through your interpreter.  For each program, compare the output or final value to that of V8’s interpreter (using `d8`).  Write automated tests that load JS code, run it in both V8 and your engine, and assert equivalence.  Start with simple arithmetic and gradually include control flow, functions, and objects.  
- **Correctness checks:**  Ensure edge cases (exceptions, `this` binding, strict mode) are handled.  Adjust implementation based on failed tests.  
- **Iteration goal:** Achieve a functioning Go interpreter that can execute JS bytecode correctly.  Many JS programs (at least basic ones) should produce correct results.

## Iteration 13: Implementation Phase – Runtime Objects and Contexts  
Implement the runtime system: heap objects, contexts (scopes), and built-in libraries.  

- **Heap and objects:**  Flesh out the `JSObject` implementation.  Decide how to represent internal fields vs. properties (maybe use Go structs for fixed fields and a map for dynamic properties).  Implement prototype chaining by having each object hold a pointer to its prototype object.  
- **Global context:**  Set up the initial global object and standard built-ins (e.g. `Object`, `Array`, `Function`, `Console`, etc.).  Create a bootstrap function to populate these (e.g. create prototypes and link methods like `toString`).  
- **Functions and call stack:**  Implement function objects and activation records (function call stack frames).  Manage local and global scopes via context objects (e.g. a slice or map of variables for each scope chain).  
- **Built-in functions:**  Port key built-in methods.  For example, implement `console.log`, basic arithmetic functions, and property access.  Many of V8’s built-ins are optimized (and some in C++), so at first implement them in Go using straightforward logic.  
- **Testing:**  Expand the test suite to cover object behavior: property reads/writes, inheritance, array behaviors, function calls, closures, etc.  Use Test262 tests incrementally here to catch semantic errors (see Testing section).  
- **Memory integration:**  At this stage, all objects are Go allocations (e.g. `new(JSObject)`).  Confirm that objects are correctly garbage-collected by Go when no longer reachable (this can be part of testing by checking memory growth).  
- **Iteration goal:** You should now have a usable JS runtime in Go: scripts can create and manipulate objects, call functions, and use built-ins, all producing correct behavior for tested cases.

## Iteration 14: Implementation Phase – Concurrency and Isolates  
Incorporate parallelism and Go-specific concurrency.  Model V8’s isolate mechanism and allow multiple instances.  

- **Isolate model:**  Implement a Go `Isolate` type that holds a separate runtime (e.g. its own global object and thread-of-execution).  Ensure that one isolate’s data is not shared with another (to mimic V8).  A simple approach is to have each isolate run in its own goroutine.  
- **Concurrency control:**  Because V8 contexts are not thread-safe ([Explanation of architecture · Issue #129 · rogchap/v8go · GitHub](https://github.com/rogchap/v8go/issues/129#:~:text=Isolates%20and%20Context%20are%20NOT,thread%20or%20not%2C%20to%20run)), ensure each isolate’s execution happens on a single goroutine/OS thread.  You may use `runtime.LockOSThread()` at the start of an isolate’s loop if you need true thread affinity.  Also provide channels or queues for sending tasks to an isolate goroutine.  
- **Parallel execution:**  Allow launching multiple isolates in parallel (for example, to handle multiple client requests).  Write tests where multiple isolates execute code concurrently without interfering.  Ensure global state is isolated per instance.  
- **Garbage collection tuning:**  If needed, explore Go runtime settings (like `GOMAXPROCS`) to optimize concurrency.  For example, you might run the garbage collector in parallel with execution; tune `GOGC` to control frequency.  
- **Iteration goal:** The engine should support running multiple independent V8-like instances concurrently.  Each instance should behave as a separate VM (like separate `d8` processes would).  This paves the way for embedding the engine in multi-threaded applications.

## Iteration 15: Implementation Phase – JIT Compilation  
Implement or integrate a JIT compilation step in Go.  

- **Strategy selection:**  Decide on a JIT approach.  Possibilities include generating Go assembly at runtime (using an assembler library), or using `go generate` to pre-generate code (less dynamic).  Another path is to compile to WebAssembly and execute that, though that diverges from “pure Go”.  Document your chosen method in the design doc.  
- **IR to code:**  Starting from your collected feedback and bytecode, translate hot functions into an IR (e.g. reuse the AST or a custom IR).  Then, implement an optimizer pass (even a trivial one) and generate machine code or Go code.  For a simple start, you could convert bytecode to Go code functions and use `go build` (with `go:generate`) to compile them.  
- **Integration:**  Ensure that when JIT is available, the engine uses it for “hot” code paths and falls back to interpreter otherwise.  For example, you might mark functions that were called many times and recompile them.  
- **Testing and safety:**  Test that JIT-generated code produces the same results as interpreted code.  Also include safeguards: if JIT compilation fails or produces incorrect code, fall back to interpreter to keep the engine correct.  
- **Iteration goal:** Have a working JIT pipeline that improves performance for frequently-run code.  Even a minimal JIT (without all TurboFan optimizations) will accelerate execution.  Note: full TurboFan parity is extremely complex, but the goal here is *practical* performance gains in Go.

## Iteration 16: Final Integration and Performance Tuning  
Refine the port for correctness and speed.  Integrate all components and optimize.  

- **Test262 compliance:**  Run as many Test262 tests as practical.  Identify failures and fix semantic bugs.  Aim to pass core ECMAScript tests to ensure full language coverage (use ([GitHub - tc39/test262: Official ECMAScript Conformance Test Suite](https://github.com/tc39/test262#:~:text=Test262%3A%20ECMAScript%20Test%20Suite%20,TR%2F104))for reference on Test262 usage).  
- **Benchmarking:**  Write or adapt benchmark tests for typical workloads (e.g. math-heavy scripts, DOM-like tasks, JSON parsing).  Use Go’s `testing` and `pprof` to profile CPU and memory hotspots.  
- **Optimize hot paths:**  Based on profiling, optimize critical sections: use `sync.Pool` for frequently allocated objects, replace interface usage with concrete types, minimize allocations in inner loops, and consider inlining performance-critical functions (using `//go:nosplit` or manual assembly if needed).  
- **Tune garbage collector:**  Monitor GC pauses and memory usage.  Adjust `GOGC` or use `debug.SetGCPercent` to balance throughput vs latency.  If Go’s GC is a bottleneck, consider object pooling or stack-allocation tricks for short-lived objects.  
- **Documentation and validation:**  Update documentation to reflect the Go engine’s behavior.  Prepare examples and usage instructions.  Compare overall performance to C++ V8 on representative scripts, noting gaps and bottlenecks.  
- **Iteration goal:** The ported engine should be functionally complete and as performant as possible in Go.  At this point, development can transition from feature-building to maintenance and incremental improvement.

## Design Document Deliverable  
Maintain a comprehensive design document throughout the iterations.  It should capture V8’s architecture and the planned Go implementation.  

- **Architecture diagrams:**  Include high-level system diagrams showing components (Parser, Ignition, TurboFan, GC, etc.) and their Go counterparts.  
- **Module descriptions:**  For each major module, write its responsibilities, classes/types involved, and how it translates to Go code.  For example, detail how `HeapObject` in C++ maps to a Go struct or interface.  
- **Data structures:**  Document the design of AST nodes, bytecode format, runtime objects, and IR.  Show Go struct definitions or pseudocode.  
- **Behavioral details:**  Explain any semantic nuances (e.g. how `this` binding is handled, how exceptions propagate) and how the Go port achieves the same behavior.  
- **Implementation decisions:**  Note design trade-offs (e.g. using Go’s GC vs custom GC, approach for JIT) and rationale for each choice.  
- **Evolution notes:**  Keep track of changes made during implementation and update the design doc to reflect the final design.  This document should serve as both a blueprint and reference for future developers.

## Context Management Strategy  
Manage learning and development in layers to avoid cognitive overload.  

- **Top-down view:**  Always start with the “big picture” (e.g. engine pipeline) before diving into code.  Use the design document and diagrams as memory aids.  
- **Incremental focus:**  Tackle one component at a time (as in the iterations above).  When working on a module, ignore unrelated details.  For example, while implementing the parser, you don’t need to think about the GC implementation.  
- **Note-taking:**  Keep detailed notes (in the design doc or issue tracker) on questions and discoveries.  Use this record to jog memory instead of trying to remember every detail.  
- **Periodic reviews:**  Regularly revisit and refresh understanding of earlier parts to reinforce connections (e.g. review how AST nodes feed into interpreter after working on interpreter code).  
- **Context switching:**  Minimize simultaneous context switching.  For example, complete the parser and its tests fully before moving on to the interpreter.  This mimics how humans learn complex systems by layering knowledge.

## Testing Strategy  
Build a rigorous automated test suite alongside development.  

- **Unit tests:**  For each Go package/module (parser, interpreter, runtime, etc.), write unit tests covering core functionality.  Use Go’s `testing` framework (`*_test.go` files) to automate these.  For example, test AST node creation, bytecode correctness, or object property lookups.  
- **ECMAScript conformance:**  Employ the official ECMAScript Test262 suite ([GitHub - tc39/test262: Official ECMAScript Conformance Test Suite](https://github.com/tc39/test262#:~:text=Test262%3A%20ECMAScript%20Test%20Suite%20,TR%2F104)).  Automate running as many Test262 tests as possible in your Go engine.  This ensures correctness against the language spec.  Start with the stable subset that passes quickly, then expand coverage gradually.  
- **Integration tests:**  Write higher-level tests that execute JavaScript programs and compare results/output to known-good results.  This can include comparing against V8’s output (`d8`) for identical code.  For example, run math calculations, string manipulations, and data structure tests.  
- **Regression testing:**  As new features are added, keep tests that cover previously fixed issues to prevent regressions.  Continuous integration should run the full test suite on every commit.  
- **Performance regression:**  Include benchmark tests (using Go’s `testing.B`) for critical operations (e.g. function calls, object creation).  Track performance over time to detect slowdowns.  Set performance thresholds if needed.  
- **Coverage analysis:**  Use Go’s coverage tool (`go test -cover`) to ensure all critical code paths are exercised.  Aim for high coverage in core engine logic.

## Performance Optimization Strategy  
Iteratively tune the Go engine for speed and efficiency.  

- **Profiling:**  Regularly profile CPU and memory (using `pprof` or similar).  Identify hotspots in interpreter loops, JIT codegen, or GC pauses.  Use these insights to focus optimizations where they matter most.  
- **Minimize allocations:**  Reduce pressure on the Go garbage collector by reusing objects.  Use `sync.Pool` for frequently created objects (e.g. AST nodes, stack frames).  Avoid unnecessary memory allocations in hot loops (e.g. reuse slices or pre-allocate buffers).  
- **Inline and optimize:**  Mark critical small functions with `//go:nosplit` or use inlining directives if needed.  Reorder code for better CPU cache locality (e.g. keep frequently accessed fields together in structs).  
- **Go-specific features:**  Leverage Go idioms for performance: channels for efficient message passing between isolates, goroutines for parallel tasks, and built-in concurrency primitives instead of custom threading.  Adjust `GOMAXPROCS` to match the expected workload.  
- **Assembly for hot code:**  For the most performance-critical parts (e.g. inner loops of the interpreter or math operations), consider writing Go assembly or using `unsafe` pointers to eliminate overhead.  Benchmark these carefully to ensure the complexity is justified.  
- **Continuous measurement:**  After each major change, run benchmarks to quantify impact.  Optimize only when profiling indicates a clear bottleneck.  Keep track of metrics (execution time, memory use) in a performance report.
