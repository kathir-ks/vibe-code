Rust has a **structured, scalable, and explicit** system for organizing code using **packages, crates, modules, and files/folders**. Here's how it works:

---

## 🧱 1. **Package**
A **package** is a bundle of one or more **crates**.

- Defined by a `Cargo.toml` file.
- Typically contains:
  - A **main crate** (binary or library),
  - Optionally multiple **binaries or examples**.

📁 **Example Layout**
```
my_project/
├── Cargo.toml      # Defines the package
└── src/
    └── main.rs     # Binary crate entry point
```

You can also have a `lib.rs` if you're building a library crate:
```
src/
├── lib.rs          # Library crate root
└── main.rs         # Binary crate root (optional)
```

---

## 📦 2. **Crate**
A **crate** is a compiled unit (like an executable or a library).

- One **binary crate** (with `main()`).
- One optional **library crate** (with `lib.rs`).
- Each crate has its own **module tree**.

You can have multiple binary crates like this:
```
src/
├── main.rs         # Main binary
└── bin/
    ├── tool1.rs    # Extra binary
    └── tool2.rs    # Another binary
```

Each file in `src/bin/` is compiled into a separate executable.

---

## 📁 3. **Module System (modules and files/folders)**
Rust’s module system is file- and directory-based.

### Declaring a Module
- `mod name;` links to a file or folder.
- The compiler looks for:
  - `name.rs`
  - or `name/mod.rs` (deprecated, use `name.rs` inside folder instead)

### Example: Hierarchy
```
src/
├── main.rs          // Root module
├── network.rs       // Module `network`
├── database/        // Submodule folder
│   └── mod.rs       // Module `database`
│   └── pool.rs      // Submodule `database::pool`
```

```rust
// main.rs
mod network;
mod database;

fn main() {
    network::connect();
    database::pool::init();
}
```

```rust
// database/mod.rs
pub mod pool;
```

```rust
// database/pool.rs
pub fn init() {
    println!("DB pool initialized.");
}
```

---

## 📚 Visibility: `pub` vs Private
- By default, everything is **private**.
- Use `pub` to expose modules, functions, types, etc.

```rust
mod internal {
    pub fn visible() {}
    fn hidden() {}
}
```

---

## 🧩 Imports: `use`
- Bring names into scope using `use`:
```rust
use crate::network::connect;
```

You can also re-export with `pub use`.

## Summary Table

| Concept     | File/Folders         | Notes                          |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Package     | `Cargo.toml`         | Contains one or more crates   |
| Crate       | `main.rs`, `lib.rs`  | A binary or library            |
| Module      | `mod xyz;`           | Refers to a `.rs` or folder    |
| Submodule   | Folder + `mod.rs` or new `.rs` file | Nested modules     |
